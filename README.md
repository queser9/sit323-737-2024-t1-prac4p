# Calculator Microservice

This project is a simple calculator microservice that provides basic arithmetic operations through a REST API. It is built using Node.js and Express.js.

## Steps

1. Set up the project:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project
   - Install the required dependencies (Express.js)

2. Create the calculator microservice:
   - Define the API endpoints for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   - Implement the logic for each arithmetic operation

3. Test the microservice:
   - Use a tool like cURL or Postman to send HTTP POST requests to the API endpoints
   - Verify the correctness of the responses

4. Document the project:
   - Create a README.md file with project overview, installation instructions, and API documentation

5. Push the code to GitHub:
   - Initialize a new Git repository
   - Commit the code changes
   - Push the repository to GitHub
